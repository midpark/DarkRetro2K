## Installation
You must have a Danbooru account to apply custom CSS on Danbooru.
On your Danbooru user settings, copy paste the base code for the theme (styles.css) and then apply a variation/color-scheme of your choice by copying the CSS of the scheme/variation and pasting it under the base code for the theme.
